# Yabladargh'

A fun Discord bot. May or may not be a sentient artificial intelligence.

## Compilation

Yabladargh' is written in Rust, and thus requires the Rust compiler. **Before** compiling Yabladargh', create a file called "token.txt" in src/ and place a Discord bot token into it.

```cargo build --release```

## Features

Yabladargh' has two primary functions:
* responding to messages in a human way
* running JS using the v8 engine

More information about the 2nd function will be available soon.
